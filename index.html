<!-- For some reason the responsive button on this navbar would not drop down for me in my browser. I tested it with noth the boostrap page (it works there) and regular code (no modifications) but still no luck on my page. Good news is the button appears when it is supposed to when you shrink the page, so that is a plus.   -->

                    <p>As you can see my name is Michael Rodriguez. One of the few crazy Colorado natives that still
                        live here. I recently took a trip to Japan! It was my first time out of the country! Now I want
                        to travel more and also go back to Japan to explore what I missed.</p>
                    <p>The picture I have here is from my solo trip to Disney Sea in Tokyo, Japan. I didn't know anyone
                        there and did not speak the local language very well but it was such a blast. Everyone was so
                        friendly, the park was very clean and the entire experience was just amazing. I stayed the
                        entire day there and can't wait to go back.</p>
                    <p>This year I am already set to head out to Spain and Portugal on a 13 day trip in August. There
                        will be a few friends I meet on the Japan trip going so it should be just as awesome. It really
                        is amazing to just get out and explore.</p>

                    <p>I have been working in the Information Technology field for 12 years now and currently working as

                        Level III Deskside Technician. With this course I hope to change direction from working with
                        hardware to working with coding and software.</p>

                        <li>I like to go fishing in the Mountains for Trout. I even learned to tie my own flies and

                        <li>I enjoy cooking for my family, especially on special occastions. Green chile,
